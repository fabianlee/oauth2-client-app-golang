##  oauth2-client-app-golang ##

A GoLang implementation of an OAuth2 Client Application in a Authorization Code flow, tailored for a Windows ADFS 2019 Authorization Server.

Supporting configuration needed on Windows 2019 ADFS fully described in my [blog walk-through here](https://fabianlee.org/2022/08/22/microsoft-configuring-an-application-group-for-oauth2-oidc-on-adfs-2019/).
